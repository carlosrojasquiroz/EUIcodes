This folder contains files for solving the Homework 1 of "Computations and Quantitative Models in Macro", in the PhD programme in Economics at the EUI. 

If you want to replicate the graphs in the slides, please open first the file Master.m.

# Master.m

In the first subsection of that file, I solve the Aiyagari's model by two methods: the value function iteration and the endogenous grid. 

Note the objects from the "partial equilibrium analysis".
